# Schedules

A schedule allows you to run a _published_ :docs-link[workflow]{id="projects/automation/workflow"} on a routine basis or as a one-off at a future date.

This is useful for automation processes that need to run on a regular basis e.g. weekly or daily.

There are several parameters that you can apply to your schedule:
- Start Date - When does the schedule start from
- End Date (_optional_) - When should the schedule be removed
- Interval - At what frequency should the schedule repeat itself
    - Do not repeat - select this if you just want to define a one off time for the workflow to be run
    - Every _x_ minutes - _allows you to specify a frequency e.g. every _5_ minutes
    - Hourly - allows you to specify a frequency e.g. every _2_ hours
    - Daily
    - Weekly
    - Monthly
    - Yearly
    - Advanced scheduler - gives you several options to define a bespoke schedule
