# Automation


An Automation Project is a place to create, store and manage your automated processes. They contain:

* Activities   :docs-link[Activities]{id="projects/automation/activity"}
* Workflows :docs-link[Workflows]{id="projects/automation/workflows/workflows"}
* Datastores :docs-link[Datastores]{id="projects/automation/datastores/datastores"}
* Schedules :docs-link[Schedules]{id="projects/automation/schedules"}

Automation is a very broad term but in Toca, automation refers to the ability to perform parts of, or all of, a business process with no human involvement. Your Toca platform will come with 1 or more virtualized workers known as Bots and these Bots can autonomously perform tasks up to 24 hours a day.

To find out more about Bots read the :docs-link[Bots]{id="bots/bots"}

One of the most important things to do before embarking on your automation project is to choose a business process that is well-suited for automation. Processes which are good targets for automation exhibit the following characteristics:

*   Repeatable
*   Clearly defined rules
*   Can be broken down into smaller steps
