# Watchlist

The watchlist is a way to isolate and view specific data for additional clarity. Right clicking on any action result or variable datachip in the activity designer will give you the option to 'watch datachip'.

The watchlist tab is located in the same area as the console. You will always see the name of the datachip but the data type and the value itself will only be shown after the chip has been put into context. If, for example, a variable is being updated dynamically throughout an activity then these changes will be reflected in real-time. For this reason the watchlist is particularly useful for debugging.

Debugging via the watchlist is especially important when used in conjunction with breakpoints because you can see all relevant values at any point in your automation.
