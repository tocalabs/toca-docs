# Outputs

To output a value is to simply say that you want to use that value somewhere outside of that activity.

To output a value, navigate to the 'input & output' tab in the activity designer and click 'add output'. This will expand the canvas and allow you to select whichever variable or action result which you would like to output.

By adding outputs to an activity, you are saying that this current activity will return these variables when it is finished. These outputs can be used as inputs for the next activity in a Workflow or they can be used to make decisions in a Workflow.

All activities contain an 'activity failed' output which returns either true or false based on whether the activity encounters any errors etc. This is also useful when making decisions in a workflow.
