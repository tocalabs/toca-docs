# Console

The console is a real-time log of every action that the Bot has run/is running.

Console is useful when you run your activity that you can see items added to the console in real time and it will show you that each action ran, when they ran, and whether they were successful or not.

You can get more information about how each action ran by expanding the action's entry in the console. The outputs of the action will be displayed and there you can check each of the results.
If an action failed then the console will also include the reason for it failing.

The console clears when you navigate away from the activity tab but you can clear the console just simply clicking on the 'Clear console' button from the bottom right of the page. You also have the option to Download as a CSV file the Console log.
