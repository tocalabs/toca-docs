# Gui Bot Options

**Interactive mode:**
Toggling interactive mode gives you the ability to interact with the bot screen and use it as you would any computer. Whilst in interactive mode you will be unable to edit actions & other aspects of the activity. **Note: To utilise clipboard functionality on the bot you must exit interactive mode and manually add the data to the clipboard.**

**Full screen** - Makes the screen of the bot occupy the entire activity designer.

When hovering your cursor over a bot screen you will see three dots appear in the top right. Clicking on these dots will reveal 4 options.

- **Upload file to bot** - This will bring up the file system on the user's machine. Choosing one will upload it to the desktop of the GUI bot.
- **Download from bot** - This will bring up the file system of the GUI bot itself. Navigate to the desired file and clicking 'choose' will download it to the user's machine.

- **Add to bot clipboard**** - This will add whatever text data is currently on the user's clipboard to the bots clipboard. If there is no data on the user's clipboard or it is not in text format e.g an image, a box will appear where you can manually input the desired text.
- **Get clipboard data** - Retrieve the data which is currently on the GUI bot's clipboard. This will only work for text data.
