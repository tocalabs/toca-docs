# Activities 

Activities are the most fundamental component of your Automation projects. They form the reusable blocks with which you can build bigger and more complex automation by assembling them into Workflow. 

It is best practice to keep Activities focused on a specific aspect of the process you are automating, and building up complexity through combining many Activities in a :docs-link[Workflows]{id="projects/automation/workflows"}.

You can create activities assigned to the Stateless or a GUI :docs-link[Bot]{id="bots"}, the Bot that is associated is the one that will run the Activity. 

> If you have no Bots assigned to your user then you cannot create an Activity as you have no resources to run the activity on.
