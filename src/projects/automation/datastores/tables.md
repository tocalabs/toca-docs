# Tables

Tables are where you can store your structured data, they are very similar to spreadsheets.
They are structured using columns and rows where columns can be defined using particular _data types_ and _default values_.
An example table can be seen below with 4 columns (`id`, `name`, `description`, `release_date`) and 3 rows

| ID | Name | Description | Release Date |
| --- | --- | ---- | --- |
|  1 | Good Will Hunting | Will Hunting, a genius in mathematics, solves all the difficult mathematical problems. When he faces an emotional crisis, he takes help from psychiatrist Dr Sean Maguireto, who helps him recover. | 06/03/1998 |
| 2 | Dead Poets Society | A group of students in a highly conservative boarding school learn to rebel against the status quo and find deeper meaning in life with the help of their new poetry teacher. | 22/09/1989 |
| 3 | Good Morning, Vietnam | Adrian, a disc jockey, goes from Crete to Vietnam to work for the Armed Forces Radio Service. While he becomes popular among the troops, his superiors disapprove of his humour. | 30/09/1988 |

Tables in the platform draw a lot of inspiration from database tables so you are also able to link tables together by defining _table relationships_.
You can also control access to your table by setting up row level permissions for granular levels of access control.
