# Layouts 

Layouts provide predefined arrangements of UI components and content placeholders for common app layouts such as Login, My Account, Home, Footer & Subscribe, Logo Section, Pricing Section, etc. You can use these layout templates as starting points and customize them as needed to match the app's branding and functionality. Layouts are best thought of as scaffolding that you can use to quickly develop your app pages, you just have to configure the content that the layouts are using.

Layouts define how various components such as Buttons, Text, Text fields, Images, and other components are positioned and visually structured on the screen.

Layouts are platform-wide, compared to blocks that are used only within the project and they are built within the TDK.

For a comparison of blocks vs layouts, see the :docs-link[blocks documentation]{id="projects/apps/designer/blocks"}.
