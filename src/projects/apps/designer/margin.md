# Margin

**Margin** is the space around a component's :docs-link[border]{id="projects/apps/designer/border"}, while :docs-link[**padding**]{id="projects/apps/designer/padding"} is the space between a component's border and the component's content. Put another way, the margin property controls the space _outside_ the component, and the padding property controls the space _inside_ the component.
