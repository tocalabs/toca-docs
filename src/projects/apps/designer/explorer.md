# Explorer 

The Explorer tab **shows all the components added to an application page**. 

The app components are arranged in the order that you define by dragging them into place on the page. Each page starts with the "root" which represents the base page, and then subsequent components that are added to the page will appear below the root. You have the option to drag each app component, just simply select it and drag it to the new place. You can also drag components directly from the components tab onto the explorer for more precise placement.

By hovering over the app component, various actions can be taken:
- **Change viewport visibility** - Clicking the icon on the left will open the viewport visibility options, alternatively hold shift and click to toggle visibility in the current viewport.
- **Switch version** - You can change the version of your component, higher versions will typically have more features and extra bug fixes, so if you are experiencing undesired behaviour in your component, ensure you are on the latest version.
- **Rename component** - Changes the name in the explorer pane, naming your components make them easier to identify and is more important the larger your app gets.
- **Select component** - Selects the component which will highlight it in blue on the page, and allows for editing via the Properties tab
- **Delete component** - Removes the component from your page

You can Copy and paste the app components across pages and apps by selecting the app component, pressing the Ctrl + C from your clipboard, selecting the new parent and pressing Ctrl + V. 

### Utilities
In the upper right corner of the tab are some buttons to assist in locating components with specific properties:

The **Highlight components with events** button will highlight components which have events (IPL) assigned to them.

The **Highlight components with responsive overrides** button will highlight components which have Responsive overrides enabled.

### Orphaned Components
Occasionally, components might become disconnected from their parent due to moves or deletions. If the platform detects such orphaned components, they'll appear under the "Orphaned Components" banner. Here, you can either delete the now-invisible data or simply drag the component back into the main tree to restore its visibility.
