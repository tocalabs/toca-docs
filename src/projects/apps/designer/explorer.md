# Explorer 

The Explorer tab **shows all the components added to an application page**. 

The app components are arranged in the order you want. Each page starts with the Root which represents the base page, and then subsequent components that are added to the page will appear below the root. You have the option to move each app component, just simply select it and move it to the new place. You can also drag components directly from the components tab onto the explorer for more precise placement.

If you hover over the app component, you will have the option to Update the component, Rename the component, Select the component or Delete it.

You can Copy and paste the app components across pages and apps by selecting the app component, pressing the Ctrl + C from your clipboard, selecting the new parent and pressing Ctrl + V. 

In the upper right corner of the tab is the *Highlight components with events* button. If you click on it, those app components that contain events will be highlighted.
