# Apps

An App represents a single web application that can be made up of one or many pages. The App project is a place to create, design and manage your app and linked resources.
An App project contains:

* :docs-link[Pages]{id="projects/apps/pages"} - An individual page in your application, each page designed with :docs-link[components]{id="projects/apps/designer/components"} and :docs-link[In Page Logic]{id="projects/apps/designer/ipl"}.
* :docs-link[App Resources]{id="projects/apps/app_resources"} - A place to manage linked resources which include :docs-link[Datatstores]{id="projects/automation/datastores/datastores"}, :docs-link[Listeners]{id="projects/automation/workflows/listener"} and :docs-link[CMS]{id="resources/cms/cms"}. This allows you to display datastore data in your app, run automation workflows and show content from your CMS.
* :docs-link[CMS]{id="resources/cms/cms"} - Manage your Content Management System with ease from your App
* Files - View, upload, download and manage files linked to your App which can be used to drive app components like Image components.
* :docs-link[App Users]{id="projects/apps/authentication"} - Manage and view your App users if your app is authenticated, you can also manage the user permissions from here using Groups and Roles.
* Theme - Modify the style theme that your App adheres to by tweaking the colour palette, typography and other miscellaneous styling properties that will apply app wide. This is useful for creating a consistent look and identity for your app.
* Settings - Manage the properties of your application like how and where it is :docs-link[deployed to]{id="projects/apps/deployment"}, if it is :docs-link[authenticated]{id="projects/apps/authentication"} andwhat permission the app users have against the linked resources.

Apps can be used to create a wide variety of web applications, ranging from simple single page forms or dashboards, to glossy and polished websites all the way to complex, richly interactive applications.
