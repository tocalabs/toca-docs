# Overview of app resources.

Apps have the ability to interact with other areas of the Toca platform.

#### Datastores

A :docs-link[datastore]{id="projects/automation/datastore"} can store data in a wide array of formats. This data can then be utilised throughout an app to drive static and dynamic content. Examples include:
- Using a table inside a datastore to fill a dynamic page with content.
- Displaying data from a datastore with a chart component.

#### Listeners

A :docs-link[listener]{id="projects/automation/workflows/listener"} is used for running automation workflows from your app. For example, in an app you may use a form layout to pass inputs defined by an app user to a workflow.

#### CMS

:docs-link[CMS]{id="resources/cms/cms"}, or content management system, is a way of storing data which is specifically tailored to being displayed in Toca apps.
