# Documentation AI

Our documentation AI chatbot aims to consolidate all existing platform documentation in one place, helping you to understand and utilize the platform better.

> All Toca AI features are experimental, we advise you carefully review any information it gives you. While the AI has been programmed not to 'guess' answers, blind spots in the documentation mean that the AI may not be aware of certain features or methods on the Toca Platform, this most often manifests as the AI informing that you cannot do something, when you can.

## What data does it have access to
In the current iteration, Docs AI is trained on:
- Platform documentation ( https://github.com/tocalabs/toca-docs/ )

As the AI does not call out to the internet, it cannot answer questions unrelated to Toca.

## How is my data used and processed
All data you enter into the AI is local, we do not send your data outside of Toca servers.

Data is removed from cache after one hour.

> Fun fact: The AI is multilingual, you can ask questions, and/or ask for responses in languages other than English
