# Documentation AI

The Toca Documentation AI chatbot helps you navigate and understand the Toca platform more effectively by bringing together all existing Platform and TDK (Toca Development Kit) documentation in one place.
You can ask it questions about the platform, or about how do use different **Actions**, **App Components**, **App Actions**, and **Connectors**.

>ðŸ’¡ Fun fact: The AI is multilingual, you can ask questions, and/or ask for responses in **English**, **German**, **French**, **Italian**, **Portuguese**, **Hindi**, **Spanish**, and **Thai**.

## What data does it have access to
In the current version, Toca Docs AI is trained on:
- Platform documentation ( https://github.com/tocalabs/toca-docs/ )
- TDK (Toca Development Kit) documentation

The AI does **not** access the internet, so it canâ€™t answer questions about unrelated topics. However, it has been trained on general technical concepts that are commonly used with Toca â€” such as JSONPath, regex, and CSS â€” and can provide helpful examples or explanations for those.

## How is my data used and processed
All data you enter into the AI is processed locally on Toca servers, we do not send any data to third-party services.

Messages you send are stored for up to one hour (to allow you to continue conversations with multiple messages), after which they are deleted. This is to ensure that the AI can provide context-aware responses during your session.
Your messages:
- Are **not** shared across Toca environments
- Are **not** used to train the AI


> All Toca AI features are experimental, we advise you carefully review any information it gives you. While the AI has been programmed not to 'guess' answers, blind spots in the documentation mean that the AI may not be aware of certain features or methods on the Toca Platform, this most often manifests as the AI informing that you cannot do something, when you can.
