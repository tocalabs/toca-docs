# Custom DateTime Formats

Custom DateTime format strings allow you to define exactly how a `DateTime` value is represented as a string. They are composed of format specifiers that represent various parts of a date and time, such as year, month, day, hour, minute, and second.

Examples of commonly used format specifiers:

- `yyyy` – 4-digit year (e.g., `2025`)
- `MM` – 2-digit month (e.g., `07`)
- `dd` – 2-digit day (e.g., `11`)
- `HH` – 2-digit hour in 24-hour format (e.g., `14`)
- `mm` – 2-digit minute (e.g., `45`)
- `ss` – 2-digit second (e.g., `30`)
- `dddd` – full name of the day (e.g., `Friday`)
- `MMMM` – full name of the month (e.g., `July`)

**Example usage:**

```csharp
DateTime now = DateTime.Now;
string formatted = now.ToString("yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss");
// Output: "2025-07-11 14:45:30"
```
