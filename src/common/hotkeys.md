# Hotkeys / Keybinds / Keyboard shortcuts

Throughout the platform we have included some hotkeys to help you navigate and work faster.

> You can access and visualise these shortcuts by typing '?' outside of an input field.

Hotkeys are divided into page hotkeys, and global hotkeys.

The page hotkeys as you might expect, pertain to actions which are only available on the current page you are viewing, these actions may appear or disappear depending on conditions on the page (as an example, a Save hotkey might only be visible if you have made changes on the page).

Global hotkeys are available at any time, and can help you to access powerful features like the documentation and platform search, or to quickly relocate to a different area of the platform.
