# 7.8 - Release Notes

## What's New

### General

#### Table Interface

Further to the Datastore design changes introduced in the :docs-link[7.6]{id="releases/7_6"} release, Tables themselves have had some extra redesign work. You can now edit rows and cells in place as well as editing multiple rows in one go. The way relational data is displayed has also been significantly improved so that you can directly view related data without having to navigate away from your existing table.

#### Reporting Improvements

A small improvement to the queries you can perform in Reports, you can now filter your reports by looking for certain inputs and outputs to a workflow. This is especially useful if you are trying to find all workflows that ran with an input of a particular value.

#### Views

You can now create Views within a Datastore, a View allows you to build a read-only table based on a static query, where you can also include columns from other tables. Head over to the Datastore to create your first View and read more about them there.
