# 7.8 - Release Notes

## What's New

### General

#### Table Interface

The Datastore view has had a significant overhaul in terms of it's look and design, this is mainly to allow user to more easily filter on the values within a Datastore based on name, type, last modified or last created.
The preview of types has also been improved so that more data can be viewed at once and the tools available for each type of value are clear.
