### General

#### Ask Tocabot - AI Docs Chat

When searching our documentation, triggered by either the `Ctrl/Cmd + K` hotkey or by clicking the search icon in the bottom, you can now ask Tocabot, our AI assistant, a question! Tocabot is trained on all of our documentation so it can draw on all of it's knowledge to find the answer you're looking for. Tocabot also has a lot of knowledge outside of Toca too, so if you need help building a regular expression or some assistance with writing a JSONPath query, just ask!

This can be very useful as Tocabot can produce an answer that incorporates information from many pieces of documentation so rather than having to manually read and search multiple pieces of documentation to reach the answer you're looking for, Tocabot can give you a concise answer that contains all the information you need.
