# File Manager

The File Manager enables administrators to browse files in the system, allowing for the identification and deletion of files that are no longer required.

> Any manual file deletions via this screen can cause data loss and operational failure. Caution should be taken to ensure the files to be deleted are safe to be deleted.

## üìÅ Navigation

- View file names, sizes, and modification dates.

## üõ°Ô∏è Deletion Safety

![File Delete Confirmation](/src/assets/file-manager-confirm-delete.png)

Any delete action in the File Browser is gated behind a **confirmation modal**. The modal requires:

- Manual input of the **exact file name**
- This extra step minimizes unintentional data loss.
