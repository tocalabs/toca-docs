# Feeds

A Feed is a way of connecting your Toca platform to a Hub, you can then browse the Packs available on this Hub via the :docs-link[Packs]{id="packs/packs"} page. To connect to a feed you need to give the following information:
- The name of the feed - _This is a friendly name that helps you differentiate between the different Hubs you have connected to your platform._
- The URL of the feed - _This is the URL that the Hub is hosted on (e.g. `https://hub.toca.io`)._
- Whether the feed requires Authorisation - This will be the case almost always with the exception of the Toca Global Hub which can be connected to anonymously (although you must authorise if you wish to push to this Hub)
- The authorisation token - This is only required if your Hub is authorised and you can get this token from the party responsible for setting up the Hub
