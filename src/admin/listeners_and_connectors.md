# Listeners & Connectors

This page in the Admin section of the platform allows you to view all the :docs-link[Listeners]{id="projects/automation/workflows/listener"} and :docs-link[Connectors]{id="projects/automation/workflows/connectors"} that are live across the platform.

From here, you can identify which workflows have Listeners and Connectors attached to them and therefore which workflows can be triggered externally.

### Listeners

From here you can:
- Update the Listener to point to a new workflow, change the inputs and update the API keys
- Delete the Listener so that the Workflow is no longer exposed via the Listener

### Connectors

Unlike Listeners, you cannot edit Connectors from this screen but you can disable and enable the Connectors which are currently live on your platform. You can also delete the Connectors from here.
As Connectors can be developed in the Toca Development Kit, they act similarly to actions in that they require building before you can use them. This page allows you to build any new Connectors that have been introduced to the platform either through the Toca Development Kit (TDK) or installed via the Pack Manager.
