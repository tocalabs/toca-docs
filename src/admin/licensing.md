# Licensing

Your license dictates the limitations of your Toca platform. The limitations apply to:
- GUI Bots
- App Users
- Number of Job Executions
- Duration of Job Executions

Both GUI Bots and App Users are accumulated throughout the duration of the license whereas number and duration of job executions are reset on the first of every month.

A license also contains two dates that dictates when the license is valid from and how long the license is valid for.

From the license page, you can see how much of your limits you have currently used and when your license is valid until.
It will also allow you to upload a new license file if your one has expired or if your limits need updating.
