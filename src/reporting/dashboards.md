# Reporting - Dashboards

Dashboards are a way of visualising your reporting data with a variety of customisable widgets. By customising the content and appearance of widgets you can create powerful and aesthetically pleasing dashboards which fully represent the work you are doing as part of Toca automation. Because each report can have multiple dashboards, you are not limited in the way that you wish to present your reporting data.

To edit a dashboard you must enter edit mode.

**Widgets** - Widgets are small components which can be used to display data in a dashboard. Each widget can have its output customised by editing the query inside of it. The query of each widget will, by default, match the query of the overall report.
