# Creating Tables

Tables are where you can store your structured data, they are very similar to spreadsheets. They are structured using columns and rows where columns can be defined using particular data types and default values. An example table can be seen below with 4 columns (id, name, description, release_date) and 3 rows

Tables in the platform draw a lot of inspiration from database tables so you are also able to link tables together by defining table relationships. You can also control access to your table by setting up row level permissions for granular levels of access control.

Creating tables is easy within Toca and can be achieved from either within a datastore itself or from within an automation activity.

## Creating Tables Within A Datastore

To create a table within a datastore, select the 'New Datastore Item' option in the top left of the datastore view page. Note the different options for the types of items that can be created here.

Select 'Table' from the list of options and the 'Add Table' modal box will now display. This is where you can configure the name, columns and rows of your table. Select '+ COLUMN' to add a column to your table. Give your new column a label and the name will be autogenerated below although this is editable if necessary. Next, select a data type for your column from the options displayed.

Once you have configured the column, select 'CREATE' to add it to your table. Repeat this process for each required column until you are happy with the table to be created. Finally, select 'ADD' in the bottom right corner to save your new table to the datatstore.

The clip below shows the creation of a simple table with 3 columns; 'Name', 'Age' and 'Registered?'

## Creating Tables Within An Activity

Creating a table within an activity can be useful when there is no need to keep the data after execution of the activity. The 'Set Variable' action can be used to create a table within an activity.

First select 'Table' in the variable type dropdown menu. This will display a 'CREATE MODEL' option as shown below.

After clicking 'CREATE MODEL', columns can be added in exactly the same way as when creating a table within a datastore.
