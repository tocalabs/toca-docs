# Toca as a Technology Stack

When you develop and build a software application, you need to think about what technologies you are going to use to put the application together. If you liken building an application to putting together a meal, you need to decide what ingredients you're going to use and if you need to use any tools like a food processor to make it. The ingredients and methods you use represent the stack you've used to create your dish!

## What is a tech stack?

A tech stack is typically defined as a combination of technologies such as databases, tools, libraries and frameworks that are used together to build and run a software application.

A tech stack for a web application often consists of the following parts:
1. A Programming Language - _What language are you going to use to define the logic in your application_
2. A Framework - _Are there any frameworks you can use which might speed up development?_
3. Libraries - _Is there any logic you can reuse from elsewhere which reduces the amount of work you have to do_
4. Front-end Technologies - _What technology are you going to use to develop your user interface?_
5. Back-end Technologies - _What technology are you going to use to develop your server-side logic?_
6. Databases - _How and where your data is going to be stored_
7. Infrastructure - _Where your application is going to run from_

When you're building a web application, you often have to worry about all of the items above and it's not uncommon for you to use totally different technologies to develop your user interface (the front-end of your application) and to develop your server-side logic (the back-end of your application). This leads to added complexity and often means you need multiple people who understand all of the different parts of your stack.

With Toca, the technology is consistent across all elements of the stack so the complexity and overhead is greatly reduced. This being said, it still offers a great deal of flexibility and configurability so whilst it is simpler to build an application on Toca, you can still put together large and complex apps.

## Full Stack Development Framework

Whilst there are many platforms out there which offer a low-code "Drag'N'Drop" interface to put together software, there are very few which offer the breadth of features that Toca does. In Toca you can build software across the full range of the stack: front-end, back-end and data.

Apps in Toca cover just about all you need to design your user interfaces and define the interactivity on each page. Automation covers all the server-side logic, including interactivity with the database layer and running flows triggered by users on your App. Datastores cover your database needs by allowing you to build tables and views. Lastly, Toca will also host and run the application that you build on it so no need to worry about sorting out infrastructure for your project when it's ready for release!
