# Advanced Features

Welcome to the next level of Toca.io! This chapter is your guide to the powerful administrative and automation capabilities that transform Toca.io from a simple low-code tool into a robust business platform. While Views (as you've learned in the previous chapter) are about organizing data, the features we'll explore here are about controlling access, automating processes, and integrating Toca.io with the rest of your digital world.

Here’s a summary of what you'll master in this section:

## Managing Your Toca Developers: Users and Groups

A key component of any successful platform is the ability to manage who can access what. We'll start with the fundamentals of user management, a critical function for any Toca.io administrator. You will learn how to:

- **Create and Update Users:** Add new team members to your Toca.io environment, assign them to specific roles, and manage their access credentials.
- **Organize with Groups:** Discover the power of user groups. Instead of managing permissions for each individual, you'll learn how to create and manage groups that reflect your organizational structure (e.g., "Dev Team," "Test Team" and "DevOps"). Assigning permissions to a group automatically grants them to all its members, simplifying administration and ensuring consistency.

## Types of Automation Bots

Automation is at the heart of Toca.io's functionality. You'll dive into the world of automation bots, which can perform repetitive tasks, from data entry to complex process flows.

- **Desktop Automation vs. Stateless Automation:** We'll take a look at the difference betwen **GUI Bots**, which mimic a user's actions by interacting with the desktop environment, and **stateless bots**, which operate in the background without a visual interface, making it faster, more scalable, and ideal for server-side tasks.
- **Bot Pools**: How these pools differ from both GUI and Stateless bots and when you should use them. This will also include how to create them

## Toca as a Service: Turning Workflows into APIs

Beyond internal automation, Toca.io allows you to expose your workflows to external systems. This is where Toca.io becomes a true integration hub. You'll learn how to transform any automation workflow you build into a secure, callable API. This enables other applications, websites, or services to trigger your workflows and leverage their power. Imagine a web form on your company's website that, upon submission, triggers a workflow to create a new customer record, send a confirmation email, and notify a sales representative—all through a simple API call.

## The Sentinel of Your Data: Permissions

Security and data integrity are paramount. The permissions system allows you to define granular control over who can see and interact with your data. We'll cover how to set permissions for both **app users** and **platform users**.

- **Entities and Data Permissions:** You'll learn how to define read, write, update, and delete permissions for your tables (entities) and even specific rows. This allows you to create a secure environment where, for example, a salesperson can only view and edit their own customer records, while a manager can see all records in their region.
- **Role-Based Access Control:** We will explore Toca.io's role-based access control (RBAC) model, which is the cornerstone of its security framework. You will see how creating roles and assigning them to users and groups is the most effective way to manage permissions and ensure that everyone has the right level of access, and nothing more.
