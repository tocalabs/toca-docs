# Profile

Before embarking on your Toca journey, it's good to make sure you've set your profile up fully. You can configure your profile to include a profile picture and name and also personalise the look of the platform. This will make it easier for other users on your platform to identify you and give the platform a more personalised feel.
To edit your profile, locate the Profile section which can be found towards the bottom of the main navigation bar in the platform:

:video{src="/src/assets/book/profile.webm"}


Once here you can configure your:
- Profile Picture
- Name
- Notification Email address - _Email address to notify you of events within the platform_
- Platform colour theme - _Default to inherit system theme_
- Password management
- Manage any links to Single-Sign-On (SSO) providers
