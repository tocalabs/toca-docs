# Hello, Toca Development Kit!

The Toca Development Kit (or TDK for short), is where you can develop new functionality for your Toca platform. From the TDK you can develop:
- Automation Actions
- Action Helpers
- App Components
- App Actions
- Connectors

The TDK provides an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) which includes a code editor, drag and drop controls and testing methods for building new functionality. Currently, this supports C# (.NET) for Automation Actions, Helpers and Connectors and React and TypeScript for App Components and App Actions.

Once you have developed your new components in the TDK, you can then deploy them to your main Toca platform so that they are available for all users on the platform to leverage in their projects.
