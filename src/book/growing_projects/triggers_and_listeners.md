# Growing Automation Projects

When your automation project starts to grow, there are a usually a couple of things that you start to feel:
1. Individual activities and workflows can get too large
2. There is often reusable behaviour stuck inside larger activities or workflows

There are several tools and features which help to deal with both of these things.

## Exclusives in Workflows

Activities are not the only place in automation that you can add flow control logic, you can also add decision points and even implement loops within a Workflow. This means that if you are looping over a large list or table of data in your automation, you don't just have to put all of this logic inside a single looping action in an activity. You can extract this control flow to the workflow level, allowing you to break your activities up into smaller and more manageable pieces.
