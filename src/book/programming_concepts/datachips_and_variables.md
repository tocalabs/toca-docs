# Datachips and Variables

Datachips are the mechanism in Toca for using a value that has come from elsewhere, be it from a Datastore or a previously run automation action. Datachips are visually represented by little chips (hence the name!) and they are colour coded and contain the corresponding :docs-link[data type]{src="book/programming_concepts/datachips_and_variables"} as well as the name of datachip.

Here are some examples of what they look like:

| Datachip Example | Description |
| :--: | :--- |
| :datachip-variable[my_number_variable]{type="Number"} |This pink datachip represents a variable which is a Number type and it is called `my_number_variable`. |
| :datachip-action[action_result]{type="Boolean"} |This green datachip represents a result that is the output of an automation action which is a boolean type. |
| :datachip-datastore[datastore_variable]{type="Table"} |Lastly, this blue datachip represents a value that is stored in a datastore which is a table. |
