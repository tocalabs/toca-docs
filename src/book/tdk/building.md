# Building in the Toca Development Kit (TDK)

In the TDK you can build:
- Automation Actions
- Connectors
- App Components
- App Actions

This means that you can bring in new functionality into the platform whenever you want.

_Need you connectors to accept XML rather than JSON? Just tweak the existing connectors_
_Need a new automation action that calculates the different between two pieces of text? Build a new Diff Text action in C#_
_Want a menu component that can have a tree structure? Build your perfect component using React_
_Have a use case for an IPL action that works out the time difference between two dates? Use TypeScript to define exactly how you want the difference outputted_

The TDK allows you to further the automation capabilities by writing C# and you can further the app capabilities by writing React and TypeScript. You can do this all from the Toca platform, you don't need to install any other technology, no dependencies or libraries, simply open the TDK and get building!

Once you have developed your new functionality in the TDK, you can then build and deploy it to the main platform so that anyone can use it, we'll look at this on the next page. Lastly, if you want to share this functionality across other Toca platforms, you can then bundle it into a pack and publish it to a :docs-link[hub]{id="packs/packs"}.
