# Welcome to the Toca Platform!

This book will teach you how to build applications with Toca.  Toca is a powerful low-code platform that empowers you to build applications quickly and visually, even if you're not a traditional programmer.  It's designed to make development accessible to everyone, from business users to seasoned developers, by minimizing the need for complex, hand-written code.

## What is Toca?

Imagine being able to create sophisticated applications without getting bogged down in syntax and intricate coding details. That's the promise of Toca.  Instead of writing lines of code, you'll use a visual interface to drag and drop components, connect them with logical flows, and configure their behavior.  Toca handles the underlying code generation, allowing you to focus on the what and why of your application, not the how.
