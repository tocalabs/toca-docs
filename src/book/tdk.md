# Extending the Platform

While Toca's low-code environment empowers users to rapidly build and deploy sophisticated applications and automation, there are instances where custom functionality or highly specialized integrations are required. The true power of a low-code platform lies not just in its ease of use, but also in its extensibility â€“ the ability to seamlessly integrate with and be enhanced by traditional code.

This chapter introduces the **Toca Development Kit (TDK)**, your gateway to extending the platform's core capabilities. The TDK provides a powerful framework for developers to craft bespoke components and actions, written in either C# or TypeScript, and integrate them directly into the Toca low-code environment. Whether you need to connect to a legacy system, implement a unique algorithm, or build a highly customized user interface element, the TDK allows you to bridge the gap between low-code agility and the limitless possibilities of high-code development. By leveraging the TDK, you can tailor Toca to your precise business needs, unlocking new levels of customization and performance for your automation and app projects.

Read on to find out how to build functionality in the TDK and then deploy them to the core platform.
