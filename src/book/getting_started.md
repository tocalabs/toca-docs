# Getting Started

Welcome to the Toca platform. This section is designed to provide you with the foundational knowledge and practical steps needed to begin your journey with our low-code development environment.

Within this section, you will be guided through three core areas:

- **Profile Setup**: Learn how to configure your user profile to ensure a personalized and secure experience.
- **Platform Overview**: Explore the various sections and features of the Toca platform. This article will provide a functional description of each area, helping you understand how different parts of the platform work together.
- **Toca Development Kit (TDK)**: Discover the Toca Development Kit, a feature that allows for platform extensibility. This article explains the purpose of the TDK and how it can be used to create custom components and integrations using traditional programming languages like C# and Python, thereby bridging low-code and high-code development.

By completing this section, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of the Toca environment and be well-prepared to build your first applications.
