# Testing

Testing is a critical phase in the development lifecycle of any software, and applications built on Toca are no exception. While low-code platforms accelerate development by abstracting away much of the underlying complexity, they do not eliminate the need for thorough testing. In fact, due to the rapid iterative nature of low-code development, robust testing can become even more crucial to ensure that applications function as intended, meet user requirements, and remain stable as they evolve.

This chapter will guide you through the essential principles and practices of testing within the Toca platform. We will explore various testing methodologies applicable to low-code automation and app development, from unit testing individual components to comprehensive end-to-end system validation. By understanding and implementing effective testing strategies, you can significantly enhance the reliability, performance, and user satisfaction of your Toca-built solutions, ultimately delivering high-quality applications that drive business value.
