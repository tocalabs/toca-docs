# Common Programming Concepts

Whilst Toca is a low-code development platform, it still borrows a lot of concepts from programming. Many programming languages have much in common at their core. None of the concepts presented in this chapter are unique to Toca, but we’ll discuss them in the context of Toca and explain the conventions around using these concepts.

Specifically, you’ll learn about variables, basic types, and control flow. These foundations will be in every Toca project, and learning them early will give you a strong core to start from.
