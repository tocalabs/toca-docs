# General Concepts

Before diving into the Toca platform, it's worth understanding some of the basic concepts that the platform was built on. These concepts range from how Automation and Apps link with each other all the way to how you can use results across the platform.

We'll also take a look at some of the general programming concepts which Toca uses in it's Automation and Apps. Whilst Toca is a low-code development platform, it still borrows a lot of concepts from programming. Many programming languages have much in common at their core. None of the concepts presented in this chapter are unique to Toca, but we’ll discuss them in the context of Toca and explain the conventions around using these concepts.

Specifically, you’ll learn about variables, data types, and control flow. These foundations will be in every Toca project, and learning them early will give you a strong core to start from.
