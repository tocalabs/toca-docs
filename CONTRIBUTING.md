# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Toca Platform docs, we'd love your help!

There are a few ways of helping with the docs: critiquing the docs, editing the docs, fixing incorrect information, adding examples and images, and documenting new or otherwise undocumented features in Toca.

We recommend you checkout the [README](./README.md) to read about what format the documentation is written in and the custom directives that are used.

If you are contributing through a Pull Request then please create a branch from latest `main` and then create a Pull Request to merge your new branch into `main`.

### Critiquing the Docs

This is the easiest way to contribute. Basically, as you read through the docs, if you find something confusing, misleading or missing then please file an issue in this repository explaining your concerns.

### Editing the Docs

Small errors like typos and broken links slip through every now and then, should you find any, we welcome Pull Requests to fix them. Equally if there are larger edits such as restructuring a paragraph so it is more readable are also welcome.

### Adding Examples and Images

Use cases and examples of where and how a feature is used can be immensely useful as they help illustrate the function of a feature. Often people will also compare their use case to the examples in the docs to validate their use of a feature, ideally every feature would have an example. If you are using a feature in a particular way and you feel it would be useful to add detail of this then please submit a Pull Request to incorporate this.

We also value images, illustrations or even short video clips if they better explain a concept. We use a tool called [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) to generate our illustrations, ideally we want all illustrations across the docs to look as consistent as possible.

### Adding Documentation

There are still lots of areas of the platform that are not documented or documented poorly, this the hardest but definitely most valuable way you could contribute. Feel free to submit a PR and please provide the screen/area of the platform that this documentation coincides with so that we can plan to add the documentation components in the relevant place.

## Where to Edit

All edits should be made in the `src` directory, this is where the content is pulled from. The folder structure aims to follow the layout of the Toca platform as closely as possible. PR's which update files outside of the `src` directory will be rejected.

Any images, multimedia or non-markdown content should be added in the `src/assets` directory.


## Checking for Fixes

The version of the docs that you can probably see on your Toca platform are probably a few weeks old so if you notice an error, check the `main` branch to see if the issue has been resolved before embarking on a fix yourself!
